Expense Tracker (Mini Project 3)

This is a small Java project I created using IntelliJ IDEA.
It is a simple Expense Tracker application that runs in the console.
With this program, I can add, view, search, and delete expenses easily.

🚀 Features
Add a new expense with:

Amount
Category
Description
Delete an expense using its ID
View all recorded expenses
Search expenses by category
Calculate the total amount spent
Handles incorrect input using exception handling
Fully menu-driven console application

🧩 How It Works
The project contains three main parts:

✔️ Expense Class
Represents a single expense item
(contains id, amount, category, description)

✔️ ExpenseManager Class
Handles all operations like:
Add
Delete
Search
View all
Calculate total
Stores all expenses inside an ArrayList.

✔️ Main Class
Shows a user-friendly menu and takes input using Scanner.

📌 How to Run (IntelliJ IDEA):

Open IntelliJ IDEA
Create a new Java project
Copy all the code into the project
Run the Main class
Use the menu to manage your expenses

📺 Sample Menu:
====== Expense Tracker Menu ======
1. Add Expense
2. Delete Expense
3. View All Expenses
4. Search by Category
5. View Total Expense
6. Exit

📝 Example Output:
Enter amount: 500
Enter category: Food
Enter description: Lunch with friends
Expense added successfully!

Total Expense: 500.0

🎯 What I Learned
This project helped me practice:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Using ArrayList to store objects
Writing clean menu-driven programs
Exception handling using try-catch
Scanner input handling in Java
