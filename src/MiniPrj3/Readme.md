📚 Algorithmic Toolkit – Mini Project 3 (Java)

This project is a simple Algorithm Toolkit built using Java.
It contains commonly used sorting, searching, collection, and analysis utilities — all combined in one single Java file for easy learning.

🚀 Features
🔹 1. Sorting Algorithms

Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Each method is simple, beginner-friendly, and includes clear steps.

🔹 2. Searching Algorithms

Linear Search

Binary Search (works on sorted arrays)

🔹 3. Collection Utilities (Generic)

Implements:

Stack (push, pop, peek)

Queue (enqueue, dequeue)

Using Java's LinkedList.

🔹 4. Analysis Utility

A simple timer function to measure execution time of any algorithm.

📄 Full Code (All Classes in One File)

The entire mini-project is written in a single Java file named:

AlgorithmicToolkit.java


It includes:

SortingUtil

SearchUtil

CollectionUtil<T>

AnalysisUtil

AlgorithmicToolkit (main class with test cases)

🧪 Test Cases Included

The main() method demonstrates:

Sorting an integer array

Searching for elements

Using stack and queue

Measuring time of quick sort

So you can run the file directly without any extra setup.
